# Pokemon-Generator
This is Personal Project to test my skills in nodejs and expressjs as well as the front end in website.

##Instructions:
First ensure that nodejs is installed in your system.
I used the Command Prompt to run this project.
For Mac, it is different.

##Working:
From the place where the project resides, open the Command Prompt.
Install npm init.
Install expressjs (npm install express).
Install nodemon (npm install -g nodemon)> // This is to ensure that server can run even if you make changes in the file.
Run the app.js file.
Open LocalHost:3000 in your browser.
There You Go.
