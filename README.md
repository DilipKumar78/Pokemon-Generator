This is Personal Project to test my skills in nodejs and expressjs as well as the front end in website.



## Instructions:
First ensure that nodejs is installed in your system.
I used the Command Prompt to run this project.
For Mac, it is different.

## Installation
Install the Required npm packages.

``bash
npm init
`` <br>
``bash
npm install express
`` <br>
``bash
npm install -g nodemon
`` <br>
## Working
Open the Command Prompt <br>
Install the Required npm Packages <br>
Run the app.js file.<br>
Open *localHost:3000* in your browser.<br>
**There You Go.**
